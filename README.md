# EnigmaWeb
EnigmaWeb is a lightweight, deployable web application that allows users to create file databases where the files can be encrypted with password protection and previewed. If you want to store un-scannable files in your personal Cloud, EngimaWeb has you covered.

## Why is it called EnigmaWeb?
The Enigma Machine was invented in 1918 by Arthur Scherbius in Germany. EnigmaWeb was developed to provide an encrypted file storage experience using web technologies.

## Why do we need it?
Browsers have become state of the art applications. Many apps available on app stores can be made with wider compatibility for fractions of the code-base and energy. EnigmaWeb is only 1,000 lines of code at its base. Cybersecurity is getting harder and harder to achieve and an offline web app makes hacking virtually impossible, a breath of fresh air in a time of insecurity.

## Due-Outs
